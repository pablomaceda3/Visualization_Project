# Visualization Project

# Objectives
* To evaluate how changes in weather, such as temperature, rainfall, and humidity have affected incidences of different communicable diseases, such as malaria, yellow fever, and dengue. 

The links to our datasets are included in the "Dataset Links" file in this repository. 

Some visualizations we have in mind are choropleth maps, bubble map chart, or bar chart on a map. 

The final design will include a map of the region of interest, attached with several layers that tie together the relevance of weather factors with the prevalence of disease. Our repository is located here: https://github.com/pablomaceda3/Visualization_Project/
